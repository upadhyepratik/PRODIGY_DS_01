# Data Distribution Visualizer -- World Bank
I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed a key task in my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. This task involved a comprehensive analysis of World Bank data, where I delved deep into the intricacies of data cleaning and analysis.

The first step was ensuring the data was clean and free from any missing values. This is a crucial step in any data science project as it lays the foundation for all subsequent analysis.

Next, I analyzed the data and created a histogram that beautifully illustrates the highest and lowest populations according to the World Bank data. This visual representation of data not only makes it easier to understand the information but also highlights key trends and patterns.

This experience has further solidified my passion for Data Science and I am excited to continue this journey. A big thank you to the team at Prodigy InfoTech for their constant support and guidance.
